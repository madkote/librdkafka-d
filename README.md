# librdkafka-d

Object oriented wrapper on top of [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka).

#### vibe.d
The wrapper does not depend on vibe.d but supports its event based engine.
To add vibe.d support add `--combined` flag to the dub command line (`dub --combined`) when you build your project.
